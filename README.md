# DYALOG
Decent Yet Another Logger - A flexible logging library written in C++11. Part of a university project.
Built with boost for handling remote connection and std::threads for asynchronism.

It's designed to be extended to fit requirements. It's not trying to satisfy everyone out of the box by unnecessary
complexity.

### Usage
Sample code is provided in examples directory and in [pseudo simulation of an app](https://github.com/Dublerq/dyalog-usage-example-client).
